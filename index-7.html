                    <p>
                        Fabulous hairstyles are there for men of different types of hair.<br>
                        Thousands of hairstyles are available all over the world. But not every hairstyle suit on<br>
                        people. And if you’re a fashion lover, trendy person you do have to know about hairstyles<br>
                        and which will suit on you. Though there are many kinds of hairstyles still these are popular<br>
                        among the young and also mid-aged generation.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Fade Haircut</strong><br>
                            The fade is a men’s haircut where the hair on the sides and back of your head gradually gets<br>
                            shorter from top to bottom. The process of fading from one length to another is generally<br>
                            achieved using hair clippers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Taper Fade</strong><br>
                            Also known as a taper, the taper fade is a clean-cut modern haircut that continues to be<br>
                            popular in barbershops. The main difference between the taper and fade is that the fade cut<br>
                            is blended into the skin while the taper leaves very short hair. The taper is an incredibly chic<br>
                            and classy look that any man can get to elevate his appearance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Low Fade</strong><br>
                            The low fade features a more even and gradual blend between the short hair around the<br>
                            ears and the longer hair near the crown than other taper or fade haircuts. The low fade is<br>
                            more subtle than some of the other fade options but no less stylish by any means. As with<br>
                            any fade, you’ll want regular cuts to maintain the clean look. The low fade pairs exceptionally<br>
                            well with some stubble or a short beard.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>High Fade</strong><br>
                            The high fade is a type of fade that features a more sudden contrast between the longer top<br>
                            and shorter sides. The high fade haircut starts near the top of the sides and back and quickly<br>
                            tapers down. Bold and edgy, this faded cut offers very short hair for a fresh look.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Mid Fade</strong><br>
                            The mid fade strikes the perfect balance between a high and low fade, creating a bold yet<br>
                            effortlessly cool look. A mid fade haircut is a cut that starts in the middle of the head and<br>
                            tapers down to the ears and neckline. This medium fade gradually blends the short sides<br>
                            and back into the longer hair, and can be the ideal complement to a stylish business<br>
                            professional hairstyle like Big Apple Barbershop

                    <h2>Hairstyle by face shape</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pull back your hair and pay attention to the length and width of individual features. The most <br>
                        important dimensions to focus on are the length of your face, the width of your forehead as<br>
                        well as the width of your cheekbones, jawline, and chin. In comparing these dimensions, you<br>
                        will be able to figure out which face shape you are and commit to a haircut and hairstyle that<br>
                        is most suited to your individual facial proportions.

                        <strong>1.Oval Face Shape</strong><br>
                        Oval face shapes are proportioned well and can handle a broad range of different hairstyles<br>
                        and lengths. A conservative quiff works well, but there is also a lot of room to experiment<br>
                        with longer lengths and modernized cuts. Your face shape can handle a voluminous<br>
                        pompadour or even longer, fuller rocker-esque shoulder-length hair. Oval face shapes also<br>
                        work well with a buzz cut and a shaved head.
                    </p>

                            <strong>Square Face Shape</strong><br>
                            You’re working with a strong jawline, which should be emphasized. We recommend opting<br>
                            for an undercut, which will make the most of your distinctive features. As this face shape is<br>
                            versatile with different types of hair, don’t be afraid to experiment with other lengths and<br>
                            styles. We recommend a lot of volume when styling your hair, so focus on fullness and add<br>
                            as much product as you desire – this face shape can handle a significant amount of hair. A<br>
                            quiff works well, whether done more classically or with a modern edge. You can also try out<br>
                            deeper side parts which will enhance your features.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Heart Face Shape</strong><br>
                            When choosing a hairstyle for your heart-shaped face, remember that you will want to<br>
                            balance out the top part of your face with the bottom, so keep your hair proportionate to your<br>
                            features. You should focus on trying to ensure that your chin doesn’t appear too narrow. A<br>
                            textured fringe or dimensional quiff will do the job- just remember that you should use a<br>
                            lightweight product to ensure that you are not creating disproportionate angles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Diamond Face Shape</strong><br>
                            Side parts work very well for gentlemen with diamond face shapes so ensure that your hair<br>
                            is textured and a little messy, which will complement your facial features better. A textured or<br>
                            angular fringe will also balance out the wider proportions of your cheekbones with your<br>
                            forehead, lending a more balanced aesthetic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Round Face Shape</strong>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Your hairstyle needs to create angles, given round faces naturally, lack shape and<br>
                        dimension. To elongate your face, try out a hairstyle with longer proportions up top and<br>
                        shorter sides. A pompadour or quiff will do just that, working to create more dimension and<br>
                        giving your baby face a more pronounced look. Note that a side part will also create more<br>
                        angles and give you a more mature look.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Your Skin Tone and The Right Hair Color</h2>
                    <p>
                        For those who regularly color their hair, whether it’s every few months or even years, more<br>
                        than likely there was one color choice along the line that was just absolutely wrong. It could<br>
                        have been that the color was too bright, too dark, faded too quickly or just made you look<br>
                        washed out. Either way, it wasn’t the right hair color for you. The best way to avoid such a<br>
                        thing from happening again (or at all for those applying hair color for the first time) is to do a<br>
                        little research and work out your skin tone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your skin tone has a big impact on how your hair color will look, and a color that clashes will<br>
                        be evident against your skin right away. On the flip side, a hair color that matches your skin<br>
                        tone will light up your face and complement your complexion. Put simply, it’ll look flattering<br>
                        and natural- which is what great hair color is all about!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It doesn’t matter whether you have been coloring your hair for years or if it’s your first time, it<br>
                        can be very hard to choose what tone will be right for you.<br>
                        Seeing a great style in a magazine or on celebrity chameleons flaunting their latest hair color<br>
                        change with fantastic results can be great inspiration. Unfortunately it does not always work<br>
                        out that way when trying the look on our own hair.<br>
                        Find your warm or cool complexion to see which hair tones will suit you best and look the<br>
                        most natural next to your skin color.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although your eyes only play a complementary role in determining your complexion, their<br>
                        color will help to steer you in the right direction when trying to work out your correct<br>
                        complexion tone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Grey and light blue are cool colours which are almost always teamed up with a cool<br>
                        complexion. There are also collections of colours which can blend into warm skin tones as<br>
                        well as cool tones, such as green, dark blue, deep brown and hazel eyes with blue or grey<br>
                        flecks. Julianne Hough has a typical cool, fair complexion teamed up with light blue eyes.

                        <li>
                            Dark chocolate brown is a fantastic shade for cool skin tones, especially for fair skin. This<br>
                            color is great for making light eyes pop and for making cool complexions glow.<br>

                        <li>
                            Icy white blonde is perfectly suited to cool complexions as well, so why not try an ultra light<br>
                            blonde? These platinum blonde locks create a stunning look when paired with a cool<br>
                            complexion and can work with both dark and light eyes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Beige blonde will also work well on cool complexions and will suit both dark and light eyes.
                        </li>

                            Copper red is another fantastic option for cool complexions, especially if you have freckles<br>
                            or a ruddy complexion.

                            Jet black is a daring option for cool skin tones that can work on any complexion from fair to<br>
                            dark. A healthy appearance as dark tones usually reflect the light better than lighter colors.<br>

                            Chocolate brown is another flattering hair color for warm skin tones, especially those that<br>
                            are medium to dark.

                            If you want to lighten things up, golden blonde may be the option for you. This color works<br>
                            on fair to dark complexions and looks great with light and dark eyes.

                            Strawberry blonde looks divine on warm skin tones, especially with blue or green eyes. The<br>
                            golden undertones make her skin glow and highlight her blue eyes.
